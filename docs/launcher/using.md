# Using the launcher

1. On startup, the launcher will prompt you with the location of the RPCS3 executable location.

:::warning

- The launcher will only work correctly if you provide the full alphabetical path to your RPCS3 executable.
- It is recommended to avoid using any specialized characters (e.g. Chinese / Japanese) characters in the path to your RPCS3 executable to ensure compatibility.

:::

2. Once the path is supplied, a check is done on the path you supplied. If the launcher cannot find any of base games version (`BLJS10250` / `NPJB00512`) installed, or if the supplied path is not pointing to a valid RPCS3 executable, it'll prompt an error.

3. On your first startup, you'll be prompted with the initialization process, this step is only needed if you don't have the `.moddedboost` file cache inside your RPCS3 directory.

4. Once the initialization is done, you'll see a list of items to be up to date, and please update them accordingly until all of them shows a green `Latest` status badge.

:::warning

The patch file `patch_05_00.psarc` is very big. Please make sure you are not using any limited bandwidth before starting the update process, and exercise patience during the update process.

5. Once all is done, launch the game and enjoy.
