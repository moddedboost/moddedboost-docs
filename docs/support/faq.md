# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is `XXX` unit missing weapons / why is this weapon not functioning?
   - This is one of the major issue of the bug, which is that a lot of weapons are not implemented yet. 
   - Some of them are technical impossibilities such as adding a 5th ammo slot, and most of them is just plain difficult to implement all at once, and require small incremental changes to the mod to fix them one by one.

### Why is my game crashing after installing the mod?
   - Please check if you have the latest mod installed in the launcher.
   - If problem still persists, please uninstall the whole game, do a clean install of the base game and make sure the base game launches fine without the mod.
     - If you can get the base game running but not the game mod, please make a detailed report on the discord forum.

### Will you do `XXX` unit / weapons?
   - If it is already what interests me, yes, but most of the time it is going to be a no for my own sanity.
   - Any grandiose new unit proposal is going to be an automatic no.

### Do you take requests or commissions?
   - No. I intend to keep this mod free of any financial incentive / monetization.  

### I want to mod too! How do I get started?
   - Unfortunately there's no easy way to mod the game in this current state unless you're very dedicated and have technical knowledge on game modding / low level programming / tooling.
   - I am currently working on an open sourced tooling called [BoostStudio](https://github.com/descatal/BoostStudio) that I intend to turn into the one stop modding studio for the game. The tool is still very much WIP and unworkable unless you have experience with C# development.
